## Description

This project will give user simple interface for list all available games from Xbox 360 which are backward compatible with and run on Xbox One.

## Motivation

I've recently bought Xbox One and I've not found simple app/website with list of all Xbox 360 games which are compatible with Xbox One. Yes, I know that Microsoft has site where is full list of games, but site is available only after user signed in and is not good looking.

I also want to create my first Android application to extend my portfolio.
